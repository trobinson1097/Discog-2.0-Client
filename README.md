# Discog-2.0-Client

Discog 2.0, an application that allows you to organize and save your personal music collection.


## Description

Discogs is a CRUD-functioning single-page application. Users can view and save discographies to their collections. Users can also remove or edit disocgs to reflect the price they got it at to keep relevant prices available to other users. 

note: This application is a passion project and my Final Capstone for Nashville Software School. Styling and layout of the UI has been kept to a minimum to ensure overall functionality stays the main focus. 

### Why Discog 2.0?

I have always had a passion for listening to and creating music so at the start of covid I began collecting cassettes. To keep track of the fast-growing collection I used 
[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) . I was inspired by the largely known application and wanted to create one that would someday fix certain features I found hard to use as a
collector. 
This application is scalable and I look forward to continuing my work on it as I develop new skills and think of new and useful features.
